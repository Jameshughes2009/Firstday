SQL make it easy to handle large amounts of data and scale up quickly

- tables can be linked based on data that is common to both of them

- A relational database organizes data into tables. A Table holds a group of data and is divided into rows and columns. The tables can be linked to form relationships

- Keys identify rows of data in a table. By matching Keys between two tables a relationship is formed!!
- SQL is a martetable skill thats used in a majoirty of databases in every economic sector
### SQL Queries
- A SQL query interacts with data in a database using the names of tables columns, and relationships betweeen tables. 
- Queries enable us to supply data to the front end to build sites that can interact with lots of data quickly and easily
